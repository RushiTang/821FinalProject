## Project Title: The Hunger Games

## Team Members:
Rushi Tang, Vicky Shao

## Project Description:
"The Hunger Games" will be a text-based adventure game developed in Python, where players navigate through dynamically generated environments, interact with objects, and make strategic decisions to survive in a Hunger Games-like setting. This project encompasses developing various classes for objects that interact within the game, such as weapons, food, medicine, animals, and tributes (players). 

## Initial Setup
- GitHub Repository: A public/private repository named hungry-games-simulation will be set up.
- Initial README.md: This document will detail the project's scope, goals, key features, and instructions on how to navigate the repository.

## GitHub Repository Structure:
- README.md: Project description and setup instructions.
- data/: 
- src/: Source code directory.
    - core/: Core game engine.
    - procedural_generation/: Procedural content generation scripts.
    - game_content/: Definitions for static and dynamic content.
- tests/: Unit and integration tests.

## Main Development Tasks:
1.	Core Engine Development:
- Issue #1: Implement game loop and basic player commands.
- Issue #2: Develop save and load game functionality.
2.	Procedural Generation:
- Issue #3: Implement procedural generation for game maps. Json file to describe the map.
- Issue #4: Develop algorithms for dynamic event and challenge creation.
3.	Game Mechanics:
- Issue #5: Implement inventory and item interaction system.
- Issue #6: Develop combat and survival mechanics.
4.	Testing and Documentation:
- Issue #9: Document setup and gameplay instructions.

## Development Practices:
- Style Consistency: Use ruff for linting to ensure code style consistency.
- Tests: Implement comprehensive tests for all features, documented in the README on how to run them. Tests must pass before merging.
- Documentation: Ensure clear documentation for setup and gameplay, ideally tested by someone outside the project team.

## Timeline:
- 2024-03-18: Project assignment details released.
- 2024-04-10: Project plan submission.
- 2024-05-02 (11:59pm EDT): Final project due.
